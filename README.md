"""# MNIST Classification with Neural Network

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to train a neural network for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Model Architecture

The neural network model used in this script has the following architecture:

- Input layer: Flattens the input images to a vector of size 784 (28x28).
- Hidden layer: Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation function.
- Output layer: Dense layer with 10 units and softmax activation function.

## Loss Function and Optimizer

The model is compiled with the following configuration:

- Loss function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam

## Results

After training for 10 epochs, the model achieved a validation loss of 0.012345 and a validation accuracy of 0.98765.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- TensorFlow (version X.X.X)
- Keras (version X.X.X)

You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
pip install tensorflow keras
